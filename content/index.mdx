The Developer Portal is the perfect place to start discovering the Polymesh universe.

Polymesh is an institutional-grade blockchain for security tokens. It provides all the foundational layers required to ensure regulatory compliance and institutional confidence. Polymesh enables  better security token creation, issuance, management, and liquidity. This blockchain was purpose-built to:

* Focus on the privacy of assets, trades, and positions, whilst taking into account the  needs of issuers, custodians, exchanges, and investors
* Provide KYC/AML-permissioning with CDD requirements customizable to cross-jurisdictional needs
* Include a governance mechanism that avoids duplication or hard forks and maintains asset functioning
* Allow for programmable and automated compliance checks with smart contracts
* Integrate with a large ecosystem of custodians, broker-dealers, KYC and CDD service providers

Polymesh unlocks the full potential of security tokens. It provides a scalable, modular, standardised, end-to-end solution tailored to the security token life cycle and the needs of capital markets.

Start with the Introduction to understand Polymeshâ€™s unique solution for regulated securities. Install everything you need to get started and dive into specialised user journeys.

Each user journey unfolds in increasing levels of detail:

* An overview that reveals the big picture.
* An introductory exercise so you can see it in action and try it yourself.
* A developer exercise that reveals the depth and breadth of what you build and how you can integrate it into your existing business processes and systems.
* Links to detailed reference documentation so you can decide how deep you want to go.

The menu on the left organises the content and the exercises in the suggested chronological order for those who wish to thoroughly explore everything this portal has to offer and complete all of the suggested exercises.

The Developer Portal is the perfect place to start discovering the Polymesh universe.

Polymesh is an institutional-grade blockchain for security tokens. It provides all the foundational layers required to ensure regulatory compliance and institutional confidence. Polymesh enables  better security token creation, issuance, management, and liquidity. This blockchain was purpose-built to:

* Focus on the privacy of assets, trades, and positions, whilst taking into account the  needs of issuers, , custodians, exchanges, and investors
* Provide KYC/AML-permissioning with CDD requirements customizable to cross-jurisdictional needs
* Include a governance mechanism that avoids duplication or hard forks and maintains asset functioning
* Allow for programmable and automated compliance checks with smart contracts
* Integrate with a large ecosystem of custodians, broker-dealers, KYC and CDD service providers

Polymesh unlocks the full potential of security tokens. It provides a scalable, modular, standardised, end-to-end solution tailored to the security token life cycle and the needs of capital markets.

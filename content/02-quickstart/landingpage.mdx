To get you started, let’s set up all there is: From the Polymesh Wallet to getting your first POLYX, we will go through a step-by-step to be ready to work with Polymesh.

To have an overall starting point for all of the following, we will help you get:
* The Polymesh Wallet through the Google Chrome extension,
* Verified as a user, i.e. finish your identity verification to let you transact with the network, and
* Your first POLYX, so that you can begin paying transaction fees and participate in governance.

		<p>The fastest way to begin using Polymesh is to create an account with the Chrome Extension.</p>
		<p>Enable your browser to interact with the Polymesh network with the Polymesh Wallet. We will help you set up the Wallet extension for Google Chrome. In the end, we will set up your new account with one unassigned key.</p>

		<p>Now that you have a Polymesh Wallet, let’s get you verified. Every Polymesh ID has to pass a minimal identity verification check as part of the network’s CDD requirement.</p>
		<p>Completing the Customer Due Diligence process lets you transact in materially-important ways. Getting verified will allow you to dive deep in the example scenarios provided throughout all chapters.</p>

	<h3>Get POLYX</h3>
	<div class="content">

		<p>POLYX is the native token for paying transaction fees and voting on governance proposals. Get testnet POLYX at no cost so you can experiment with the Alcyone testnet.</p>
		<p>Do you want to get your hands on your first POLYX? No problem! Just follow the steps and in a short amount of time, we will have you spending your first POLYX.</p>

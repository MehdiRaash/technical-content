Before diving into the conceptual and technical specifics, and exploring all the different aspects of Polymesh, let us take a closer look at the value proposition of Polymesh.

Polymath, the organisation creating Polymesh, provides technology to create, issue, and manage digital securities on blockchain. Its quick to market approach aims at connecting regulation and compliance of traditional securities with blockchain technology. This is the main difference between Polymath's approach and the one of general-purpose blockchains, such as Ethereum: The design is focused on a precise solution to specific requirements, rather than a generalised solution to abstract requirements.

Until today, creation, issuance, and ongoing management of traditional securities have been inefficient and ineffective. There is a solution to these inefficiencies and ineffectiveness: security tokens.

## A new infrastructure to a new asset class

Similar to traditional securities, security tokens represent ownership interests in an asset. They can represent ownership of:

* traditional assets (i.e. publicly traded equity, bonds, debt, etc.), or
* traditionally illiquid assets (i.e. private placements, real estate, artwork, intellectual property, synthetic asset baskets, etc.).

At the same time, they are created digitally and use blockchains to structure and automate functioning.

The digital representation of an asset by issuing a token on the blockchain is called tokenisation. Tokens are created through a type of initial coin offering (ICO). There are different types of tokens that can be created: utility, equity, and security tokens.

Security tokens are used to raise funds through a security token offering (STO), which is similar to an initial public offering (IPO).

## What do security tokens bring?

The benefits of security tokens are multiple. Let’s dive into them!

The gain in **efficiencies** are passed on to the issuer and investor of the token. Through the use of security tokens, legacy middlemen can be removed to save costs. In addition, profit from efficient fundraising and trading, reduced settlement times, and improved processes of dividend issuance, voting capabilities, and liquidation preferences are among the efficiency gains. The tokenised cap table reduces overhead, administrative work, and the transfer time.

Security tokens allow for a **24/7 market access** allowing for greater accessibility and opening up liquidity opportunities. Among others, greater **liquidity** is a result of the hyper-fractional asset ownership (i.e. tokens are divisible in ways traditional tokens aren’t), the tokenisation of traditionally illiquid assets, and access to a global investor pool through new asset classes.

Investors have the opportunity to **diversify** their portfolio as they gain access to previously unavailable or traditionally illiquid assets. In addition, a perfect record of ownership at any time with all transactions is maintained. The increased **transparency** ensures investor protection and mitigates actions of foul play, such as back-dating of documents.

Overall automation is another benefit of security tokens, as **automated compliance and payments** become possible. Jurisdictional regulations can be enforced as they are built into the security token’s smart contract. The same applies for automated payments, for example in case of dividends as specified by the issuer.

## Polymesh – Institutional-grade blockchain for security tokens

Polymesh is a purpose-built blockchain with a focus on regulated security tokens. This focus reflects in Polymesh’s enterprise features,  governance, security, and consensus.

The network provides functionalities for asset management, and includes financial abstractions at its base layer (i.e. primitives). Thus, a user can initiate a set of embedded on-chain actions (i.e. extrinsic) like creating an asset, settling instructions, or taking part in on-chain governance. Using so-called smart extensions - smart contracts deployed on top of the Polymesh blockchain – functionalities can be added to the base layer primitives. For example, asset issuers can implement additional transfer restrictions through smart extensions. Users can benefit from the advantages of standardisation and deep integration of the primitives, and built-in complex and customised functionalities to meet regulatory and capital market demands.

In comparison to general-built blockchains, in which smart contracts are the foundational layer of security tokens creating programmable and automated tokens, Polymesh provides further foundational layers to fulfill regulatory compliance and foster institutional confidence to enable security token creation, issuance, management, and liquidity.

Architecturally, Polymesh is a public, permissioned blockchain. Meaning anyone can run a node, as well as check the upholding of network rules and the public state secured by the blockchain, but not everyone can run nodes that author new blocks or vote on block finality, only specific entities, called operators can. The Polymesh blockchain has its own native token for payments and security requirements called [POLYX](https://developers.polymesh.live/polyx/).

To provide a blockchain specialised for security tokens, Polymesh is built on **four pillars**: identity, governance, confidentiality, and compliance.

## Challenges of security tokens

General-purpose blockchains, like Ethereum, have their challenges when compliance with regulatory demands meets the necessities of global capital markets. The main challenges focus on questions of identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance.

Traditionally, security regulators seek to protect investors from unfair and/or fraudulent practices, while promoting fair and efficient markets, as well as stable financial systems with reduced systemic risk. Stability and efficiency drive capital formation. Therefore, issuers are required to present fulsome public disclosure and reporting, and customer **identities** have to be validated through Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks.

For general-purpose permissionless blockchains, meeting most regulatory requirements addressing identity contradicts the philosophical core and functioning of the blockchain, especially due to pseudonymity, which makes identity validation difficult to establish. Even when adding identity-related solutions as second layer add-ons, additional complexity results in the end-to-end solution.

Polymesh has an advantage over general-built blockchains, as asset issuers and other financial intermediaries can examine the Polymesh blockchain to confirm questions regarding participant identities. This assists with regulatory compliance. For example, token holders cannot subvert rules by using multiple identities to hold assets, because all users can only act through their on-chain identity and all on-chain identities are referenced through decentralised identifiers (DIDs). Also issuers and institutions don’t need to re-identify users and users don’t have to re-submit their information streamlining the identity verification processes, and at the same time reducing costs. This purpose-built blockchain is more resilient and less vulnerable to attacks targeting the reputation system (i.e. [Sybil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) attacks).

When it comes to **compliance**, requirements continuously evolve leading to further complexities and a remaining need for often-proprietary systems with added elements of automation. Manual intervention remains a big element of compliance systems. This ineffective automation creates costs and inefficiencies for all participants.

General-purpose blockchains cannot help to solve ineffectiveness and inefficiencies. Implementing evolving compliance regulation would be complex, and with it would bring high computing costs and processing times.

Polymesh addresses compliance questions by implementing comprehensive automation enabling faster processing and lower protocol fees. Issuers can set flexible and extendable rules and automate rule enforcement without the need to manually or semi-manually approve individual transfers reducing costs. Rules can be combined and tailored to the asset's type, jurisdiction, and regulatory regime. Additionally, leveraging the Polymath Unique Identity System (PUIS), it enforces entity- and identity-level compliance. It makes on-chain compliance implementation possible. So to say, compliance management is built into the security token.

Another essential feature of capital markets is **confidentiality**. One can neither know who holds a security, nor how much of a security is held by someone. Institutions protect private and financial client information as part of privacy requirements.

In a general-purpose blockchain, anyone can observe the holdings of any public address. As pseudonymity rules, token holders do not have complete anonymity and could be discovered. Adding a second-layer solution for confidentiality could maintain privacy of transactions but the token issuer could not satisfy compliance and ownership reporting demands.

With Polymesh, the amount a token holder holds and transfers is encrypted and private through zero-knowledge proof. With its confidential transactions, the permissioned blockchain allows issuers to configure the security token as confidential. Polymesh’s focus on the privacy of assets, trades, and positions is central for its identity model to obfuscate user’s positions.

General-purpose blockchains especially have difficulties with **governance**, i.e. how changes are decided, managed, and implemented. Change management requires significant coordination between the blockchain’s nodes and disagreements regarding changes have the potential for disruption. In case a disagreement on changes and their implementation cannot be resolved, the blockchain can split into two separate chains operating differently, i.e. a fork. This leads to legal and regulatory uncertainty stemming from the difficulty of conducting upgrades.

Polymesh provides the opportunity to upgrade seamlessly without forks as it is a feature of the chain. Additionally, its on-chain governance process allows users to create proposals for upgrades and supports changes on the blockchain. The sophisticated governance mechanism allows the blockchain to grow and develop through a built-in blockchain control. Thus, avoiding duplication or forks while providing a functioning infrastructure for digital assets.

The so-called Polymesh Improvement Proposals (PIPs) can be introduced by any user. They are evaluated through a combination of signals from the community, input from technical experts (committees), and decisions by the **Governing Council**. PIPs can be submitted for network upgrades, to set parameters related to consensus and security, or other actions. The governance system is inherently designed to decentralise over time.

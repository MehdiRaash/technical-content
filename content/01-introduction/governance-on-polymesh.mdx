# Governance

*Governance in blockchains means a set of rules outlining the chain management, change implementation, and decision-making responsibilities.*

In blockchains, governance is always a very difficult but equally important topic. This is especially true for blockchains on which security tokens are issued, as the chain is the source of truth, i.e. it establishes the state of facts.

There are two distinct **types of governance** in blockchain networks:
-	On-chain governance (rules and decision-making are on-chain), like in the case of Tezos, Cardano, Polkadot and Polymesh, and
-	Off-chain governance (debates in forums like Reddit, conferences, et.), such as in Ethereum or Bitcoin.

On-chain governance is beneficial due to the transparency of rules and the inclusion of users in the decision-making process.

General-purpose blockchains are often challenged by change management. Disagreements on changes to the blockchain or their implementation can lead to forks. In case of hard forks, there is no current legal or regulatory clarity. Therefore, there is significant coordination necessary between the nodes that run the blockchain’s software to successfully implement upgrades. At the same time, blockchains have to be able to adapt and evolve.

## Governance on Polymesh

Governance is established in **upgrades** and **on-chain governance**. The governance system is designed to be compatible with regulatory regimes and provide a solution to the challenges general-built blockchains have in the areas of identity, accountability, confidentiality, system governance and evolution.

Governance encompasses the following areas:
-	System primitives ruled by governance, such as inflation care, penalties, bonding periods,
-	Chain upgrades, and 
-	The validation of existing operators.

Operators have to be validated to implement a permissioned blockchain and manage permission roles. Validation is bound by the governance system fostering decentralisation.

Chain **upgrades**, i.e. changes to the protocol of a blockchain, are essential for the blockchain to evolve. **General-purpose chains**, such as Ethereum, face a coordination problem when it comes to updates. As updates have to be accepted, i.e. implemented, by the nodes running the blockchain’s software, and much of the governance process is off-chain, i.e. updates are debated in forums outside of the chain, coordination is essential. In case of disagreements regarding the updates or their implementation, forks are likely. Especially hard forks, a change in the protocol of a blockchain that is not backward-compatible, deciding the state relevant for security tokens is impossible. Additionally, currently no legal or regulatory certainty exists for the instance of a hard fork. This aspect is unappealing for capital market participants and regulators.

**Polymesh** doesn’t encounter this type of coordination challenges as governance is conducted on-chain, and upgrades are decided and implemented by certain stakeholders as delineated in the current governance system. Moreover, the node binary is on-chain. Meaning an upgrade leads to a change of the on-chain representation of the binary. Thus, each node checks if there is a new binary, and if there is, starts working with that new version automatically. The possibility of hard forks is therefore highly unlikely.

Another aspect of Polymesh that adds to the improbability of hard forks is the choice to use WebAssembly, a Bytecode to enable high-performance applications on webpages, to avoid bugs because of the operating system. Software bugs could create a divergence, which leads to a fork but this remains highly unlikely. Polymesh’s clear-structured governance mechanism assists in achieving the finality required for legal transfer and payment probability. This is a big value added compared to the offer of general blockchains.

Adding to the fork improbability, Polymesh is built on the [Substrate Framework]( https://www.substrate.io/). It allows for [forkless runtime upgrades]( https://www.parity.io/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-polkadot/), which results in seamless upgrades on the blockchain rather than risking a hard fork, as well as the recording and storing of the governance information on-chain. Any change to the blockchain is recorded directly on it. This is convenient from a chain management standpoint and enables the possibility for users to have a say in the chain management through a user-friendly interface, the governance dApp.

## The governance process

Upgrades to the Polymesh blockchain can be submitted for review and approval through a Polymesh Improvement Proposal (PIP). Proposals are concrete, on-chain actions. Areas relating to the off-chain realm are not addressed by PIPs.

Polymesh bases its governance on a **two chamber approach**. The first chamber consists of all POLYX token holders. Any POLYX holder has the right to submit a PIP by submitting detailed information regarding the change and bond POLYX to the PIP. The second chamber is the Polymesh Governing Council.

Let’s take a closer look at the stakeholders involved in governance!

Governance in Polymesh includes **three stakeholders**:
-	the POLYX token holders,
-	the Committees, and
-	the Governing Council.

The **Committees** are groups of individuals with five to 20 members. They are categorised by topics. Committees can submit PIPs, so-called community-curated PIPs. These are always considered by the Governing Council, the decision-making body.

The **Governing Council** is a group of individuals or identities. It is the body responsible for decision-making. Currently membership in the Committees and Governing Council is not mutually exclusive, i.e. members can be part of both at the same time. Membership for the Genesis block, i.e. the first block in the chain, is already set. The council’s composition can be changed in the future through a PIP.

This can be changed in the future through a PIP. The primary role of the Governing Council is to manage the blockchain, find consensus, and chart the general direction of development for the blockchain. It can fast-track proposals to deal with emergency fixes.

The governance process is comprised of the following **stages**:
1.	Proposal
2.	Signalling
3.	Voting
4.	Governing Council meeting

Let’s take a more detailed look at the different stages of the governance process! How does a PIP become an upgrade to the Polymesh blockchain?

To **propose** an upgrade a PIP has to be submitted. One can bond some POLYX to the proposal and add information specifying the proposal. When a PIP is submitted, the PIP is visible but cannot be voted upon during a cooling-off period. Still, the proposal can be amended or deleted.

After the cooling-off period, the PIP is open for **support signalling**, so to say voting by the community of token holders: POLYX token holders can signal support or dissent with the PIP by bonding POLYX to it. The native token is used as an indicator of the proposal’s popularity.

The **voting** for the signalling phase depends on the number of POLYX tokens. Whereas one POLYX equals one vote. This could be modified by a PIP. The number of POLYX tokens can be split, but at all times, one cannot use more POLYX than one holds at the time. During the bonding, the POLYX is locked. It can **only** be withdrawn. Staking on the bonded tokens is still possible. This conditions don’t make users opt between the network security and the use of tokens. Once the proposal is through, i.e. the PIP reached enough support, or in case votes are withdrawn, the tokens are freed.

After PIPs finalise the signalling stage, they are considered in a **Governing Council Meeting**. First, a snapshot of the proposals is taken and ordered by the number of “Yes” and “No” votes for each proposal. This determines the order in which the proposals are discussed by the council. The number of proposals revised each session can be determined by the council.

How is the order of debate determined exactly? Does it go from most to least important proposal? The order of debate is the order of the snapshot.

When considering the individual PIPs, council members can either “approve”, “reject”, or “skip” a proposal. There is only a fixed number of times a proposal can be skipped before it has to be approved or rejected, as a decision for each proposal is required.

Now, the signals come into play. The signals from the token holders are indications for the Governing Council to base their decisions on it in regard to support for a PIP as well as perceived importance. Signalling can be understood as a result of a compromise between managing the ecosystem while also investing a large amount of assets.

Once the Governing Council approves the PIPs, the so-called **Release Coordinator** executes the PIPs, i.e. schedules their implementation. The Release Coordinator is a member of the Governing Council, which can be replaced.

The proposals are implemented on-chain, as PIPs and the snapshot are token-curated.

Transparency can be a tricky characteristic when it comes to voting procedures in general. In Polymesh, transparency is limited on voting records. Meaning, one cannot know who voted how, only the vote result as such.

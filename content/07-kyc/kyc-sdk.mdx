Using the Polymesh dashboard for KYC is all well and good but it does not scale well.

A KYC Service provider may want to scale their business by integrating with existing internal systems. Consider a queue of KYC requests, user-facing onboarding systems and other methods of gathering information followed by evaluation and a decision. The decision itself can be optionally committed to Polymesh in the form of an attestation.

A level-0 integration of an existing KYC system with Polymesh would be to keep the Polymesh dashboard open and have an operator copy paste addresses from one system to another and press buttons repeatedly. Beside the risk of error, it lets operators have access to the KYC company's private keys, which could potentially be used for other purposes.

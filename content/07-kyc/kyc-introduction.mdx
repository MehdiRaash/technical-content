KYC is short for Know Your Customer and describes the slew of services that gravitate around the concept of identity. A KYC service provider is a company that can provide such a service related to identity.

CDD is short for Customer Due Diligence and describes the necessary steps that have to be taken for an identity to be credible.

## Approach to Identity and Compliance

Because anyone really can pose as a KYC service provider, Polymesh offers a 2-tier level of credibility to such providers. There are:

1. **Trusted CDD providers** are the providers that can create a brand new identity on-chain, and the corresponding attestation of CDD, thereby allowing entities to operate on the Polymesh platform. This _inner sanctum_ is tightly controlled, and they can be added and removed only through an-chain governance process.
2. **General KYC providers** are any entity on Polymesh that is willing to provide attestions about other entities. These providers are not controlled by any on-chain process, and it is up to participants to enlist them and demand CDD attestations for compliance.

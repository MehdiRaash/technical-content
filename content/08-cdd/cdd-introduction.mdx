## Minimum KYC Requirement

Polymesh enforces a system-wide minimal KYC requirement. In order to transaction regulated securities the parties must complete Customer Due Dilligence (CDD) first. 

Even in a case where the originator of a regulated security has specified no KYC requirements, the CDD requirement remains in effect. In this way, CDD can be understood as the minimum viable KYC process that all users who have regulated assets have passed.

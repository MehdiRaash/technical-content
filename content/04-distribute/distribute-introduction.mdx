Let's start with: **What is a distribution?**

Capital distributions are a common procedure in the financial world. Most capital distributions are payments related to assets from an account, fund, or individual security to investors or other beneficiaries, or those related to payments of stock or other payouts to shareholders.

The source for a distribution can be a number of financial products. Still, a distribution usually consists of a direct payment to a beneficiary.

As distributions are essential for financial products, especially securities, they have also found their way into the Polymesh design.

## Asset distribution on Polymesh

When it comes to distribution, Polymesh can do more than record a corporate action on-chain. It can handle capital distributions natively on-chain to, for example, distribute dividends associated with an asset token.

Asset distribution is a part of corporate actions on Polymesh.

How is asset distribution conducted on Polymesh?

First, a corporate action (CA) is created with a predictable or unpredictable benefit using ```initiate_corporate_action```.

Once the CA is created, a distribution is attached to the CA using the dispatchable ```distribute``` from the capital distribution pallet.

The distribution includes specifications on the amount of currrency to be distributed from the portfolio of the so-called **corporate action agent (CAA)**, and a start and expiration date.

The corporate action agent is the one to initiate a corporate action (CAA). By default, the asset owner is the CAA.

The [capital distribution pallet](https://docs.polymesh.live/pallet_corporate_actions/distribution/index.html) offers the needed variety of functionality to distribute benefits, predictable and unpredictable ones. There are functions to:

* Start a distribution,
* Claim or push benefits of a distribution, and
* Reclaim unclaimed dividends.

The pallet includes the following dispatchable functions:

* ```distribute```,
* ```claim```,
* ```push_benefit```,
* ```reclaim```, and
* ```remove_distribution```.

```distribute``` starts the capital distribution. Then with ```claim``` a benefit is pulled. The benefit claim can be done for active capital distributions on behalf of a token holder. The default for ```claim``` pulls the benefit to a default portfolio. Whereas, ```push_benefit``` pushes a benefit of an active distribution.

As long as the distribution hasn't reached its payment date, ```remove_distribution``` let's cancell the capital distribution. In case of an expired distribution, one can ```reclaim``` forfeited benefits - a distribution is active beginning with ```distribute``` and the start time.

## Asset checkpoints - Permanent records

During the life of a token, some actions require knowledge of the asset distribution. _Who owns how much?_ Examples include capital distribution and corporate ballots. Moreover this knowledge typically needs to be collected for a specific point in time, and available now and later. _Who owned how much on January 1st, 2021?_

To achieve this, Polymesh implements a classic **lazy-checkpointing** mechanism. In effect, upon creation, the checkpoint only records:

* the date at which it was issued
* the total supply at the block height it was issued

Note how "_who owns how much_" is missing from the record at creation. Since there is no limit to the number of investors, there would be no limit to the number of copy operations. Instead, to find out "_how much did Alice own?_", the system first looks into the checkpoint records for a value, and if missing that, picks Alice's balance now.

To make it possible, Polymesh keeps an eye out and will record in the checkpoint the previous balances of parties before any transfer between said parties. Or any other action that changes balances for that matter.

For the avoidance of doubt, if there are no transactions after the checkpoint's creation, then it will not record any held balance as, indeed, the current blockchain data is the same as the desired data at the checkpoint.

One can create a checkpoint in 2 ways:

* Create it immediately
* Schedule future creation(s) at intervals

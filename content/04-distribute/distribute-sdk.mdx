As always, everything that can be done via the Token Studio dashboard can be integrated with internal systems using the SDK. Use this to automate and scale repetitive processes. Let us see how ACME's share distribution would be performed using methods in the SDK. What we want to achieve is for ACME to issue 20,000 shares of ACME Co to Alice the individual. As CEO, Alice will act for ACME.

## Preconditions

We assume that:

* ACME, the company already has a Polymesh identity, `acme`.
* Alice, ACME Co's CEO and acting agent, holds a secondary private key for `acme` that allows her to act on its behalf.
* Alice the CEO can [instantiate](https://developers.polymath.network/polymesh-sdk-api-reference/classes/polymesh#static-connect) a Polymesh client whenever she needs to act with:
    <MultiCodeBlock>

    ```typescript
    const apiCeo: Polymesh = await Polymesh.connect({
        "nodeUrl": "wss://alcyone-rpc.polymesh.live", // For instance, or the proper network
        "accountMnemonic": "word31 word32 ..."
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    const apiCeo = await Polymesh.connect({
        "nodeUrl": "wss://alcyone-rpc.polymesh.live", // For instance, or the proper network
        "accountMnemonic": "word31 word32 ..."
    });
    ```

    </MultiCodeBlock>
* The ACME token has already been created and has been retrieved and instantiated with the following.
    <MultiCodeBlock>

    ```typescript
    const token: SecurityToken = await apiCeo.getSecurityToken({
        "ticker" :"ACME"
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    const token = await apiCeo.getSecurityToken({
        "ticker" :"ACME"
    });
    ```

    </MultiCodeBlock>
* `acme` is the owner of the ACME token. `acme` will also be the token's primary issuance agent.
* Alice has another identity, `alice`, that represents her as an individual.
* Alice the individual also can [instantiate](https://developers.polymath.network/polymesh-sdk-api-reference/classes/polymesh#static-connect) a Polymesh client whenever she needs to act with:
    <MultiCodeBlock>

    ```typescript
    const apiAlice: Polymesh = await Polymesh.connect({
        "nodeUrl": "wss://alcyone-rpc.polymesh.live",
        "accountMnemonic": "word1 word2 ..."
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    const apiAlice = await Polymesh.connect({
        "nodeUrl": "wss://alcyone-rpc.polymesh.live",
        "accountMnemonic": "word1 word2 ..."
    });
    ```

    </MultiCodeBlock>

## Prepare the distribution

Time for Alice to get her agreed amount of shares. As we mentioned in the previous chapter, implicit in `const token` is that the `context` is `apiCeo`, because we used `apiCeo` to retrieve its information. In other words, any action performed on a `token` instantiated by `apiCeo` will effectively be done by the `acme` identity.

At the time of its creation, the ACME token had a total supply of zero. Alice is personally entitled to 20,000 of the eventual 100,000 total supply of shares that the founders intend to issue. The primary issuance agent first issues, in effect mints, the shares to themselves, then sends them to their ultimate beneficiary(ies), like Alice. Sending securities to someone needs the consent of the recipient. The correct Polymesh structure to achieve that is to create a settlement instruction. And all settlement instructions are created in a venue. Therefore, we will create venue. 

Let's get started:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const acme: CurrentIdentity = await apiCeo.getCurrentIdentity();
const distributionVenueQueue: TransactionQueue<Venue> = await acme.createVenue({
    "type": VenueType.Distribution,
    "details": "For ACME Co"
});
const distributionVenue: Venue = await distributionVenueQueue.run();
const distributionVenueId: string = distributionVenue.id.toString();
```

```javascript
const acme = await apiCeo.getCurrentIdentity();
const distributionVenueQueue = await acme.createVenue({
    "type": "Distribution",
    "details": "For ACME Co"
});
const distributionVenue = await distributionVenueQueue.run();
const distributionVenueId = distributionVenue.id.toString();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

We keep `distributionVenueId`, the string id of the venue, for later as this is information that will need to be shared with the ultimate recipient. Now that we have the venue, let's have the CEO [issue](https://developers.polymath.network/polymesh-sdk-api-reference/v/docs%2Falpha/classes/issuance#issue) enough shares to later transfer to Alice. Of course, if the CEO planned on issuing shares for all founders of ACME Co, she would issue more.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const token: SecurityToken = await apiCeo.getSecurityToken({
    "ticker": "ACME"
});
const issuance: Issuance = token.issuance;
```

```javascript
const token = await apiCeo.getSecurityToken({
    "ticker": "ACME"
});
const issuance = token.issuance;
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Here too, in `issuance`, the context is still `apiCeo`. In fact, its [`parent`](https://developers.polymath.network/polymesh-sdk-api-reference/classes/issuance#properties-1) is the `token` itself.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const issueQueue: TransactionQueue<SecurityToken> = await issuance.issue({
    "amount": new BigNumber("20000")
});
await issueQueue.run();
```

```javascript
const issueQueue = await issuance.issue({
    "amount": new BigNumber("20000")
});
await issueQueue.run();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

<HighlightBox type="tip">

There is no beneficiary to mention because an `issue` command sends the shares to the issuance agent, which, at this point is `acme`. Additionally, it sends the shares to the identity's default portfolio.

</HighlightBox>

At this point, ACME, has 20,000 received shares. We still need to send them over to Alice the individual.

## In which portfolio?

Now, Alice does not want to receive her ACME shares into her default portfolio. Instead, she wants to have them sent to a new "cold store" portfolio, she first needs to [create](https://developers.polymath.network/polymesh-sdk-api-reference/classes/portfolios#create) the portfolio.

Here we are talking about Alice, the eventual owner, not the CEO, so we are going to use _her_ Polymesh client instance:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const alice: CurrentIdentity = await apiAlice.getCurrentIdentity();
const portfolios: Portfolios = alice.portfolios;
const portfolioQueue: TransactionQueue<NumberedPortfolio> = await portfolios.create({
    "name": "Cold store"
});
const coldStore: NumberedPortfolio = await portfolioQueue.run();
```

```javascript
const alice = await apiAlice.getCurrentIdentity();
const portfolios = alice.portfolios;
const portfolioQueue = await portfolios.create({
    "name": "Cold store"
});
const coldStore = await portfolioQueue.run();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

To [retrieve](https://developers.polymath.network/polymesh-sdk-api-reference/classes/portfolios#getportfolio) the portfolio at a later date, anyone can use the string `coldStore.id`, or find the portfolio by name. Time to [move](https://developers.polymath.network/polymesh-sdk-api-reference/classes/portfolio#movefunds) the shares. Now that Alice has created the portfolio in which she wishes to receive her shares, she needs to prepare some information for her alter ego, the CEO:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const aliceDid: string = alice.did;
const coldStoreId: string = coldStore.id.toString(10);
```

```javascript
const aliceDid = alice.did;
const coldStoreId = coldStore.id;
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Moving the shares, finally

Who creates the settlement instruction to move the shares? Alice the CEO, on behalf of ACME, so let's flip back to the proper context: `apiCeo`. From her end, she needs to re-instantiate some instances given the previous information:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const acme: CurrentIdentity = await apiCeo.getCurrentIdentity();
const acmeDefaultPortfolio: DefaultPortfolio = await acme.portfolios.getPortfolio();
const acmeDid: string = acme.did;

const alice: Identity = await apiCeo.getIdentity({
    "did": aliceDid
});
const aliceColdStore: Portfolio = await alice.portfolios.getPortfolio({
    "portfolioId": new BigNumber(coldStoreId)
});
```

```javascript
const acme = await apiCeo.getCurrentIdentity();
const acmeDefaultPortfolio = await acme.portfolios.getPortfolio();
const acmeDid = acme.did;

const alice = await apiCeo.getIdentity({
    "did": aliceDid
});
const aliceColdStore = await alice.portfolios.getPortfolio({
    "portfolioId": new BigNumber(coldStoreId)
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Now to the settlement instruction:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const distributionInstructionQueue: TransactionQueue<Instruction> = await distributionVenue.addInstruction({
    "legs": [{
        "amount": new BigNumber(20000),
        "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
        "to": aliceColdStore,
        "token": token
    }]
});
const distributionInstruction: Instruction = await distributionInstructionQueue.run();
const distributionInstructionId: string = distributionInstruction.id.toString(10);
```

```javascript
const distributionInstructionQueue = await distributionVenue.addInstruction({
    "legs": [{
        "amount": new BigNumber(20000),
        "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
        "to": aliceColdStore,
        "token": token
    }]
});
const distributionInstruction = await distributionInstructionQueue.run();
const distributionInstructionId = distributionInstruction.id.toString(10);
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

This instruction is now recorded in the blockchain as pending. Alice the CEO is satisfied with it. She does not need to affirm it as the SDK identified her affirmation would have been required anyway, and so used the relevant [`add_and_affirm_instruction` extrinsic](https://docs.polymesh.live/pallet_settlement/enum.Call.html#variant.add_and_affirm_instruction) right away.

## Does Alice agree?

Let's return to Alice, the future share owner, and seek her affirmation. Since she is most likely on another computer or system, we need once more to reinstantiate the instruction from Alice's point of view. For that to happen, Alice the CEO needs to send, or copy-paste, `acmeDid`, `distributionVenueId` and `distributionInstructionId` to Alice's system:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const acme: Identity = await apiAlice.getIdentity({
    "did": acmeDid
});
const venue: Venue = (await acme.getVenues()).find((venue: Venue) => {
    return venue.id.isEqualTo(new BigNumber(distributionVenueId));
});
const pendingInstructions: Instruction[] = await venue.getPendingInstructions();
const aliceInstruction: Instruction = pendingInstructions.find((instruction: Instruction) => {
    return instruction.id.isEqualTo(distributionInstructionId);
});
```

```javascript
const acme = await apiAlice.getIdentity({
    "did": acmeDid
});
const venue = (await acme.getVenues()).find((venue) => {
    return venue.id.isEqualTo(new BigNumber(distributionVenueId));
});
const pendingInstructions = await venue.getPendingInstructions();
const aliceInstruction = pendingInstructions.find((instruction) => {
    return instruction.id.isEqualTo(distributionInstructionId);
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Alice could also have chosen to retrieve all the pending instructions associated with her `CurrentIdentity`. That would have included all instructions, not just that one from the distribution venue she knows about. With a view to reduce the possibility of spam, she chose to use the venue to retrieve the instructions.

Now, it is just a matter of affirming the instruction:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const updatedInstructionQueue: TransactionQueue<Instruction> = await aliceInstruction.affirm();
const updatedInstruction: Instruction = await updatedInstructionQueue.run();
```

```javascript
const updatedInstructionQueue = await aliceInstruction.affirm();
const updatedInstruction = await updatedInstructionQueue.run();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

And with this, Alice got her 20,000 shares.

## Can she confirm she received the shares?

Well, she can check what's inside her portfolio:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const coldStore: NumberedPortfolio = await alice.portfolios.getPortfolio({
    "portfolioId": new BigNumber(coldStoreId)
});
const acmeTokenBalances: PortfolioBalance[] = await coldStore.getTokenBalances({
    "tokens": [ "ACME" ]
});
const acmeTokenBalance: PortfolioBalance = acmeTokenBalances[0];
assert(acmeTokenBalance.total.isEqualTo(new BigNumber("20000")));
```

```javascript
const coldStore = await alice.portfolios.getPortfolio({
    "portfolioId": new BigNumber(coldStoreId)
});
const acmeTokenBalances = await coldStore.getTokenBalances({
    "tokens": [ "ACME" ]
});
const acmeTokenBalance = acmeTokenBalances[0];
assert(acmeTokenBalance.total.isEqualTo(new BigNumber("20000")));
```

</MultiCodeBlock>


## How can Alice issue the shares of other founders?

As the primary issuance agent, she can repeat the steps to create one instruction per founder. On the other hand, if the founders have decided that they should all receive their shares in a single atomic instruction, then, Alice would have to create a single instruction with all the legs:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```typescript
const issueQueue: TransactionQueue<SecurityToken> = await issuance.issue({
    "amount": new BigNumber("100000")
});
await issueQueue.run();
const distributionInstructionQueue: TransactionQueue<Instruction> = await distributionVenue.addInstruction({
    "legs": [
        {
            "amount": new BigNumber(20000),
            "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
            "to": aliceColdStore,
            "token": token
        },
        {
            "amount": new BigNumber(30000),
            "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
            "to": bobTargetPortfolio,
            "token": token
        },
        {
            "amount": new BigNumber(50000),
            "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
            "to": carolTargetPortfolio,
            "token": token
        }
    ]
});
const distributionInstruction: Instruction = await distributionInstructionQueue.run();
const distributionInstructionId: string = distributionInstruction.id.toString(10);
```

```javascript
const issueQueue = await issuance.issue({
    "amount": new BigNumber("100000")
});
await issueQueue.run();
const distributionInstructionQueue = await distributionVenue.addInstruction({
    "legs": [
        {
            "amount": new BigNumber(20000),
            "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
            "to": aliceColdStore,
            "token": token
        },
        {
            "amount": new BigNumber(30000),
            "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
            "to": bobTargetPortfolio,
            "token": token
        },
        {
            "amount": new BigNumber(50000),
            "from": acmeDefaultPortfolio,
            "to": carolTargetPortfolio,
            "token": token
        }
    ]
});
const distributionInstruction = await distributionInstructionQueue.run();
const distributionInstructionId = distributionInstruction.id.toString(10);
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Or whichever distribution was agreed between the parties. The advantage of this single operation is that all parties can see in one go whether the eventual outcome is as per previously agreed.

## When all is done

Assuming all parties have received their shares, it could be advantageous for the company to create a checkpoint. This post-issuance checkpoint would provide visibility about what was achieved during the issuance.

<!-- TODO when SDK exposes that -->

## Connect to the Dashboard

## Select the correct signing key

## Send the asset to the other party

Normally, the user will simply wait for the KYC provider to work with the other party to complete the KYC process if it is not already completed. For this exercise, we will switch to ExKYC's point of view and verify the recipient, then return to ACME's perspective to observe the completed distribution.

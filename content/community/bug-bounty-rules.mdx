Polymath’s websites or services are not part of the Program. Please see Exhibit A for the list of libraries and items within scope a detailed description of the scope of the Program. If you believe you have found a Vulnerabilitysecurity vulnerability in Polymath’s blockchain related source code and associated related binaries that are within scope, we encourage you to let us know right away by submitting a Report. We will investigate all legitimate Rreports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Before submitting a Reportreporting, though, please review these Termsthis page, including our Responsible Investigation and Reporting requirements (section 2.2 below), Reward Detailsreward guidelines (in Exhibit B), and the Program Scope (in Exhibit A).

If you choose to share your information through this feature, this information will be public and others may use it or share it with third parties.
As a condition of participating in this Program, Participants give Polymath and its agents permission to share their name, address, and other contact or Bounty Payout information to third parties (such as payment services) for the purpose of administering this Program and complying with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. If you choose not to give your consent, you must notify Polymath in writing at bugbounty@polymath.network, in which case Polymath may, in its sole discretion, disqualify you either from receiving the applicable Bounty Payout(s), from the entire Program, or both. 

### (3) NOTIFICATIONS:
Public announcements regarding the Program will be made in the Polymath Developer Discord Channel.  Notifications in connection with submitted Reports and Bounty Payouts will be made by email using the email address provided.  It is each Participant’s sole responsibility to receive and monitor those methods to timely receive, review, and respond as needed to notifications. Failure to timely respond or complete any of the steps set forth in the notification and verification procedures for any reason, including filtering or failure by any potential recipient to notice or accept a communication from Polymath or its representative, may result in disqualification of such potential recipient from receiving the Bounty Payout. Polymath reserves the right to contact Participants for verification purposes and administration of the Program. All Polymath’s decisions are final and binding in all matters relating to this Program. 

### (4) BOUNTIES:
Recipients will receive Bounty Payouts depending on their Reports, subject to verification. See Exhibit B for current information regarding Bounty Payouts, including how Bounty Payouts are calculated (collectively, “Rewards Details”), which Polymath may change at any time with reasonable notice according to [Section 7] below. We may change the Bounty Payouts and the manner in which they are calculated at any time. All Bounty Payout details not specified in these Terms (including Exhibit B) will be determined in Polymath’s sole discretion. Bounty Payouts are not the property of any Participant until they are actually received. 
Bounty Payouts are made in United States Dollars. Polymath is not responsible for a potential recipient’s inability to accept or receive a Bounty Payout for any reason. We are not able to issue Bounty Payouts to individuals who are on the sanctions lists or who are in countries on sanctions lists.
Any taxes (federal, national, state, prefectural, territorial, provincial, and/or local) and other costs and expenses associated with Bounty Payout acceptance or receipt will be the sole responsibility of the recipient. No more than the stated Bounty Payout will be awarded. Polymath will not replace any lost or stolen Bounty Payouts or any Bounty Payouts that are undeliverable or do not reach the recipient because of an incorrect or changed address or contact information. If a recipient does not accept the entire Bounty Payout, the unaccepted part of the Bounty Payout will be forfeited, and Polymath will have no further obligation with respect to that Bounty Payout or portion of the Bounty Payout. Recipient is strictly prohibited from selling, auctioning, trading, or otherwise transferring its entitlements to Bounty Payouts. Polymath may be unable to make Bounty Payouts (for example, by a government or regulatory agency), impractical (e.g. excessive transfer costs, duties or taxes), or impossible for Polymath to award to Participants who live in some jurisdictions. Polymath reserves the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the payment of such Bounty Payout in such circumstance or substitute the Bounty Payout or portion thereof with another reward or portion thereof of equal value (in Polymath’s view). Each Participant waives the right to assert as a cost of receiving any Bounty Payout any and all costs of verification and costs to claim the Bounty Payout and any liability and publicity which might arise from claiming or seeking to claim said Bounty Payout.

- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Wire Information (Bank Name, Bank Address, Account Number, SWIFT Code)

Here’s the classification of rewards as per the severity of the bug reported:

| <b>Severity</b> | <b>Description / Example</b> | <b>Reward</b> |
|-|-|-|
| CRITICAL<br/>(CVSS 9.0 - 10.0) | Ability to put chain data into an unexpected state <br/>which otherwise doesn't cause any disruption, <br/>forcing the emission of events which are incorrect. | USD 3000 - 5000 |
| HIGH<br/>(CVSS 7.0 - 8.9) | Ability to use an extrinsic panic unexpectedly <br/>without proper handling, block the on-chain governance <br/>system from it's expected behaviour, block other users<br/>from their ability to perform expected tasks (griefing). | USD 1000 - 3000 |
| MEDIUM<br/>(CVSS 4.0 - 6.9) | Ability to put chain data into an unexpected state which <br/>otherwise doesn't cause any disruption, forcing the <br/>emission of events which are incorrect. | USD 250 - 750 |

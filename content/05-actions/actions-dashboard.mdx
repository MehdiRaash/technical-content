## Exercise

Following ACME's IPO, the shares are widely distributed and traded. Let us imagine that it has been a very good quarter since ACME went public and the board now wishes to distribute a dividend. Each shareholder will be entitled to receive a portion of the divident in proportion to the number of shares they own. 

To prepare for this, the signer will need access to on-chain funds to send and permission to use those funds for this purpose. If you have been following the previous examples, your Polymesh ID should have permission. For a deep-dive into access control and permissions in Polymesh, see here =>

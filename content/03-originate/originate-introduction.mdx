Polymesh makes it exceptionally simple to originate a regulated security. It is a well-defined process. There is more than one way to accomplish it and your decision will usually be based on scale. 

For example, a business may only occasionally issue new securities in which case the intuitive manual approach will be sufficient. Service providers who routinely issue securities for their clients may with to eliminate repetition. In this case, create an integration with internal systems and automate the process. 

Before we dive in, let us consider what we need to accomplish.

## The Security

It will be helpful to consider a hypothetical real-world situation. Although Polymesh offers options to address many edge cases, this is a very simple example. Let us suppose that ACME Inc. (ACME) wishes to create a security for it's upcoming IPO. 

- The security will represent equity in the firm
- 100 million authorized shares will be created

## Compliance

ACME will create the securities on the Polymesh blockchain. Since ACME is required to ensure compliance, ACME will first make important business decisions. 

- Choosing and engaging a KYC Service Provider. ACME chose EzKYC.
- Defining the KYC Requirements and establishing an agreed process that the KYC Service Provider will provide
- Defining jurisdictional properties ...

## Standardization

All this is configurable through Polymesh. Unlike Smart Contract-oriented blockchains where all of the security properties and compliance processes would need to be painstakingly codified, Polymesh presents a well-solved solution that requires only configuration to record the choices that were made when the business decisions were finalized. Compliance is built in and attends to concerns such as ensuring that securities are only transferred to known entities, in authorized jurisdictions and the confidentiality of users and their holdings is maintained. 

Securities on Polymesh are all constructed from the same basic structure which simplifies integrations and interoperability.

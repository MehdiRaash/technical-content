## Exercise

Let us walk through the asset origination process using the Polymesh Wallet, a browser and the Polymesh Dashboard. 

- We will originate the asset described in the overview =>
- If you do you already have a Polymesh Wallet you should install it now =>
- You will need some PolyX to pay for network resources as you send transactions. If you do not have any PolyX then you should get some free PolyX for the Testnet =>
- Everyone on Polymesh who sends a materially significant transaction must, at a minimum, complete the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) process. If you have not already done so, complete CDD now. =>
